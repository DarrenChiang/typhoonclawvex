# Typhoon Claw Robotics Team


## About Us

In light of the Design Thinking process and hands-on experiences that are critical in shaping studentsâ€™ project learning, critical thinking, and team building skills, the Typhoon Claw Robotics Team, which consists of the students in the Robotics II VEX course, has been created to transform the course into competition-oriented, in which the students will learn through the preparation for the 2017-2018 Asia Open VEX Robotics Competition - High School in December 28 to December 31, 2017 as well as future competitions that follow.

> This will be our first time participating in a VEX competition and we will see how this goes. In order to be more prepared for our next competition, we will reflect on our preparation and come up with an improvement plan.
