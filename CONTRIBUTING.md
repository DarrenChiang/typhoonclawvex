# Contribution Guidelines

## Commits

Commits and general work is done on the "working" branch
// Comment your code clearly (but don't over-comment!)
When committing, give your commit a suitable name. For larger changes, briefly describe what was changed in the commit description.

## Merging

After checking that the code runs properly, open a merge request to merge branch 'working' into 'master'
When that is done, one of the CODEMASTERS will resolve merge conflicts and approve the merge.

# It's that simple :)
